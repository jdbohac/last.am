        dev:'Taito',
        year:'1991',
        genre:'Beat-em Up',
        synopsis: 'A 6-level, sideways scrolling beat-em-up for 1 or 2 players that defies any logic in either its theme or its graphical approach; that places the players in a dream-like world populated by armies of strange and bizarre creatures. PuLiRuLa\'s plot centres around the world of \'Radishland\'. Each of Radishland\'s six towns is kept running smoothly with the aid of a giant key, which is necessary to keep the world\'s \'time - flow\' moving. The key is stolen by a mysterious enemy and the timeflow is disrupted. Players must fight their way through waves of increasingly abstract enemies in their quest to recover the key and restore time to Radishland. To aid players in their quest, they are each armed with a magical stick, with which they can hit and defeat the game\'s abstract enemies. Players are also armed with a limited number of smart bombs, capable of killing multiple enemies. The smart bombs are as visually unique as the rest of the game; taking the form of such things as a herd of running animals, a purple dancing blob-like man or a man in a giant microwave oven who captures and cooks any on-screen enemies. When killed, the enemies disappear and an animal or townsperson is released from inside the creature.',

        genre:'Racing',
        synopsis: 'Designed by the legendary Eugene Jarvis (creator of, among other things, "Robotron" and "Defender"), Cruis\'n USA is a point- to - point racing game featuring fourteen separate courses set in a number of different US locations. Each race takes place against nine other rival cars.In addition to the player\'s opponents, the roads are packed with civilian traffic that must be avoided. Any collision with either other vehicles or with trackside objects will result in lost time as the player races against both the clock and the nine rival racers. On many tracks, collisions can be avoided by driving off-road, although this has as inverse effect on both handling and speed. The in -game physics are skewed entirely toward arcade - style handling.The aforementioned collisions have vehicles bouncing and spinning as though made of rubber, before righting themselves back on the track.',

The player\'s on-screen counterpart carries a portable jetpack under his arm, which allows him to fly as well as run along the ground. The jetpack is equipped with a laser, allowing the player to destroy both the game\'s many enemies as well as a variety of obstructions, such as trees and the floating rocks on level 1.',

Killer Instinct introduced incredibly complex combos to the fighting genre, as well as including the Fatalities and Humiliations made famous by Midway\'s "Mortal Kombat" Series.',
